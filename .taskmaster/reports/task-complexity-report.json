			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Define `AgentState` TypedDict for Graph State Management",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is atomic and does not require further expansion.",
			"reasoning": "This is a very simple task involving the definition of a Python TypedDict. The code is already provided, making it a matter of file creation and copy-pasting. It is too small to be broken down."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement `call_model` Node for vLLM Interaction",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the `call_model` node into the following subtasks: 1. Implement logic to fetch and cache tool definitions from the FastAPI-MCP server. 2. Create a function to construct the complete prompt/message list from the `AgentState`. 3. Implement the core vLLM client invocation logic. 4. Develop the response parsing logic to extract tool calls and update the `agent_outcome`.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct steps: external data fetching, complex prompt construction, an API call to an LLM, and structured response parsing. Each of these steps can be developed and tested as a separate unit, justifying a breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement `call_tool` Node for Single Tool Execution (MVP)",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the `call_tool` node implementation into two subtasks: 1. Create the Python wrapper function for the tool that makes the HTTP request to the FastAPI endpoint. 2. Write the unit test for this wrapper function using `requests-mock`.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is lowered by using LangGraph's pre-built `ToolNode`. The main work is creating the specific tool's wrapper function and its corresponding test, which are two distinct and manageable subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement `should_continue` Conditional Routing Node",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is atomic and does not require further expansion.",
			"reasoning": "This task is a minimal function with a simple if/else statement. The logic is straightforward and self-contained, making it too small to subdivide."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Assemble MVP LangGraph StateMachine",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the graph assembly task into these steps: 1. Instantiate the `StateGraph` and add all required nodes. 2. Define and add all edges, including the entry point and the conditional edge. 3. Develop the end-to-end integration test for the compiled graph, mocking all external services.",
			"reasoning": "This is a key integration task. While the code is declarative, correctly defining the graph's nodes, edges, and conditional logic requires careful setup. Separating node definition, edge definition, and testing makes the process more systematic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Orchestrator with Live vLLM and FastAPI Services",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the live integration task into the following subtasks: 1. Implement configuration management for live service URLs and credentials. 2. Add startup logic to the application to fetch live tool definitions. 3. Design and execute a suite of end-to-end tests against the live, deployed services.",
			"reasoning": "Complexity arises from moving from a mocked environment to a live, distributed system. This involves configuration, networking, and cross-service debugging, which are distinct from pure code implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance `call_tool` for Sequential Multi-Tool Execution",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this enhancement into two parts: 1. Update the `call_model` test mocks to generate responses with multiple sequential tool calls. 2. Create a new integration test for the `tool_node` that verifies it executes multiple tools in order and correctly accumulates all results.",
			"reasoning": "The underlying library already supports this feature, so the task is low complexity. It's primarily about creating the test case (mocking the LLM) and validating the expected behavior, which are two separate steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Parallel Tool Execution in `call_tool` Node",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the parallel tool execution task: 1. Implement the custom `parallel_tool_node` function using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. 2. Replace the existing `tool_node` with the new `parallel_tool_node` in the graph definition. 3. Develop a unit test for the node that mocks multiple tools with artificial delays. 4. Write a performance test to confirm parallel execution.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces concurrency, which is inherently complex. It requires creating a custom node, managing a thread pool, and handling concurrent results. Separating the node implementation, graph integration, and specialized testing is necessary."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Refine LLM Prompting to Encourage Parallelism",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the prompt refinement task: 1. Draft and iterate on the new system prompt that explicitly describes the parallel tool-use capability. 2. Create a set of high-quality few-shot examples. 3. Develop an evaluation suite with specific user queries to measure success.",
			"reasoning": "Prompt engineering is an iterative and empirical process. The complexity lies in designing effective prompts and a robust evaluation framework, not just writing text. These are distinct activities: prompt writing, example creation, and evaluation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add Error Handling to Tool Execution Node",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the error handling implementation: 1. Modify the tool execution node to wrap calls and format any caught exception into a standardized error string. 2. Write a suite of unit tests that mock tools to raise different exceptions and assert that the correct error string is returned.",
			"reasoning": "While libraries can help, correctly catching various exceptions and formatting them into a consistent state update requires dedicated logic. Separating the implementation from the comprehensive testing of different error cases is a good practice."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Feedback Loop to LLM",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the error feedback loop task: 1. Verify that the `call_model` node correctly incorporates error messages from `intermediate_steps` into the next prompt. 2. Create an end-to-end integration test where a tool is forced to fail and verify the error is passed back to the LLM for a recovery attempt.",
			"reasoning": "This is an integration task connecting error handling (Task 10) with the model calling node (Task 2). The complexity is in ensuring the state flows correctly and validating the end-to-end behavior, which warrants a dedicated integration test."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Stateful Conversation History",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the conversation history integration: 1. Implement logic to initialize and manage the `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` object. 2. Modify the main request handler to load history into the `AgentState` before invoking the graph. 3. Modify the handler to save the new input and final response to memory after the invocation.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces state management across multiple requests, which affects the application logic outside the core graph. Separating the memory management from the pre-invocation loading and post-invocation saving clarifies the implementation."
